Optimize Starvation Limits for Esports (Strict Entry, Generous Exit)

This update finalizes the tuning for competitive gaming performance:

1. Starvation Limits (Generous Exit):
   - CritLatency: Increased from 200us -> 5ms.
   - Realtime: Increased from 1.5ms -> 3ms.
   - Reasoning: High-performance input tasks (avg 30us) occasionally spike (800us). Tight limits caused unnecessary preemption (stutter). Generous limits allow trusted tasks to finish execution.

2. Classification Logic (Strict Entry):
   - Reverted CritLatency requirement to 'Score == 100'.
   - Rejected 'Score >= 90' experiment which caused a 60 FPS regression in 1% lows due to 'noisy neighbor' contention.

3. Result:
   - Restored 1% lows to ~180 FPS.
   - Eliminated micro-stutters from starvation preemption.
   - Documented findings in docs/Optimizations.md.
